        "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in open-ended language generation thanks to the rise of large transformer-based language models trained on millions of webpages, such as OpenAI's famous [GPT2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/). The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are impressive, e.g. [GPT2 on unicorns](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples), [XLNet](https://medium.com/@amanrusia/xlnet-speaks-comparison-to-gpt-2-ea1a4e9ba39e), [Controlled language with CTRL](https://blog.einstein.ai/introducing-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/). Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role.\n",
        "\n",
        "This blog post gives a brief overview of different decoding strategies and more importantly shows how *you* can implement them with very little effort using the popular `transformers` library!\n",
        "\n",
        "All of the following functionalities can be used for **auto-regressive** language generation ([here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/) a refresher). In short, *auto-regressive* language generation is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next word distributions:\n",
        "$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) \\text{ ,with }  w_{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n",
        "\n",
        "and $W_0$ being the initial *context* word sequence. The length $T$ of the word sequence is usually determined *on-the-fly* and corresponds to the timestep $t=T$ the EOS token is generated from $P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_{0})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Auto-regressive language generation is now available for `GPT2`, `XLNet`, `OpenAi-GPT`, `CTRL`, `TransfoXL`, `XLM`, `Bart`, `T5` in both PyTorch and Tensorflow >= 2.0!\n",

        "As *ad-hoc* decoding methods, *top-p* and *top-K* sampling seem to produce more fluent text than traditional *greedy* - and *beam* search on open-ended language generation.\n",
        "Recently, there has been more evidence though that the apparent flaws of *greedy* and *beam* search - mainly generating repetitive word sequences - are  caused by the model (especially the way the model is trained), rather than the decoding method, *cf.* [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). Also, as demonstrated in [Welleck et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02492), it looks as *top-K* and *top-p* sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf), the authors show that according to human evaluations, *beam* search can generate more fluent text than *Top-p* sampling, when adapting the model's training objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-ended language generation is a rapidly evolving field of research and as it is often the case there is no one-size-fits-all method here, so one has to see what works best in one's specific use case.\n",
